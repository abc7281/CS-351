## Julia Set

This image was generated by our CUDA kernel with constant  
`c = center = (0.0, 0.0)` and pixel size vector `d = (domain.x/Width, domain.y/Height)`.

![Julia set for c = (0.0,0.0)](images/julia.ppm)

*You can experiment by changing the `center` and `d` values in `main()` to explore different Julia sets.*
