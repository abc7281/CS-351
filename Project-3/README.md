# Project 3 - WebGL Shapes

triangle – Renders a simple yellow wire-frame triangle with three vertices drawn as a line loop; no fill and no animation.

decagon – Draws a solid yellow regular decagon (10-sided polygon). It uses a triangle-fan with a centre vertex and stays fixed on-screen.

star – Draws a solid yellow star whose points alternate between a long (radius 1) and short (radius 0.4) vertex. It is static (no spin or colour change).

star-rot – A spinning version of the yellow star (no colour grading). Geometry alternates radii like star, and the whole shape rotates over time.

star-color – Same star geometry as above, but it spins continuously and blends colours: outer points fade to red, inner points to blue, giving a two-tone rotating star.
